### *Game rules* ###  
In the game, mines are scattered throughout a board, which is divided into cells.
Cells have three states: unopened, opened and flagged. An unopened cell is blank
and clickable, while an opened cell is exposed. Flagged cells are unopened cells
marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location; some implementations make
flagged cells inoperable to reduce the risk of uncovering a suspected mine. A player
selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a mined cell, the game ends in a loss.
Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines
diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (or "0"), and all adjacent non-mined
cells will automatically be opened. Players can also flag a cell, visualized by a flag
being put on the location, to denote that they believe a mine to be in that place.
